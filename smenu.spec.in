%description
This simple tool reads words from a file or the standard input, presents
them in a cool interactive window after the current line on the terminal
and writes the selected word, if any, on the standard output.

After having unsuccessfully searched the NET for what I wanted, I
decided to try to write my own.

I have tried hard to made its usage as simple as possible. It should
work, even when using an old "vt100" terminal and is "UTF-8" aware.
