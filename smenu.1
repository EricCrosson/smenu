.SH DESCRIPTION
This small utility acts as a filter (reads from stdin and writes to
stdout). All the words taken from stdin are presented in a scrolling
window on the terminal at the current cursor position.
.P
A selection cursor is initially positioned on the first selectable word
by default.
.P
It is possible to filter the selectable words in the input stream by
using an include regular expression to match the selectable words
and an exclude regular expression to match the non-selectable words.

Notice that when some words are excluded they can no more be re-included
after.
.P
Non-selectable words are skipped when moving the selection cursor and
cannot be searched for.
.P
The \fB-W\fP option can be used to set the characters (or multibyte
sequences) which will be used to delimit the input words. The default
delimiters are: \fISPACE\fP, \fI\\t\fP and \fI\\n\fP.
.P
The \fB-L\fP has a similar meaning for lines.
.P
Special character sequences formed by a \fI\\\fP followed by one of the
characters \fIa\fP \fIb\fP \fIt\fP \fIn\fP \fIv\fP \fIf\fP \fIr\fP and
\fI\\\fP are understood and have their traditional meanings.
.P
Quotations (single and double) in the input stream enable to ignore the
word separators so that a group of words are taken as a single entity.
.P
Non printable characters in words that are not a delimiter are
converted to their traditional form (\fI\\n\fP for end-of-line,
\fI\\t\fP for tabulation...) by default. A single dot (\fI.\fP) is also
used as a placeholder otherwise.
.P
\fBWarning\fP, \fBUTF-8\fP encoded codepoints are quietly converted
into a dot (\fI.\fP) when the user locale is not \fBUTF-8\fP aware like
\fBPOSIX\fP or \fBC\fP by example.
.P
.SS "Moving among words"
The cursor can then be moved in every direction by using the
keyboard arrow keys (\fB\(<-\fP,\fB\(da\fP,\fB\(ua\fP,\fB\(->\fP)
or the \fIvi\fP direction keys (\fBh\fP, \fBj\fP, \fBk\fP and \fBl\fP).
\fBHOME\fP, \fBEND\fP, \fBPgDn\fP and \fBPgUp\fP can also be used if
available and have their traditional meanings.
.SS "Searching for a word"
The \fB/\fP or \fB^F\fP (\fBCtrl-f\fP) can be used to initiate a
search by prefix among the words after the cursor.
.P
After that the cursor attribute is modified and all the characters
entered 7s after this change go in a search buffer with the cursor
moving immediately to the next word matching this prefix. Any character
entered within 5s after that completes that buffer and resets the 5s
timer and possibly moves the cursor again.
.P
As soon as the timer ends, the search mode is ended and the cursor
regains its initial appearance.
.P
The search buffer is persistent as long as the cursor is on a matching
word when a new search is initialized.
.br
If the beginning of the word under the cursor does not match the
previous search buffer, then the search buffer if erased.
.P
At any time in this mode you can move the cursor with the keys
described above. \fBESC\fP ends this mode immediately.
.P
The \fBSPACE\fP or \fBn\fP key repeats the last search if the search
buffer is not empty. As in search mode, nothing happens if there is no
matching word after the cursor.
.P
Note that the \fBSPACE\fP and \fBn\fP keys cannot be used when the search
mode is active because they must be available if you want to search a
word containing these characters.
.SS "Selection and Exit"
Hitting \fBq\fP exits without outputting anything, nothing is selected.
.P
By default, hitting \fBENTER\fP writes the selected word to stdout when
not in search mode. In search mode \fBENTER\fP ends this mode and does
nothing more. If you want to be able to select a word \fIeven\fP in
search mode, use the \fB-r\fP option to change this behavior.
.SS Help
A small help message can be displayed when hitting \fB?\fP. This display
will last for 10s or until a valid key or \fBESC\fP is pressed.
.SS Scroll bar
A scroll bar is displayed at the right of the scrolling window. Its
appearance is meant to be classical but it has some particularities:
.IP * 2
The scroll bar is not displayed if all the input words fit on only one
line.
.IP * 2
Otherwise, the scroll bar is always displayed except when the \fB-q\fP
option is set. This option completely disables the scroll bar display.
.IP * 2
When the scrolling window has only one line, the scroll bar has only 3
states:
.RS 2
.IP - 2
"\fBv\fP" when on all but the last line, indicating that you can go down
to see more.
.IP - 2
"\fB^\fP" when on the last line.
.IP - 2
"\fB|\fP" otherwise.
.RE
.IP * 2
When there is more than one line to display, "\fB/\fP" means that the window
displays the first line, "\fB\\\fP" the last line. "\fB|\fP" is used to fill
the gap, see below the different possible configurations.
.TS
l l l l l
l l l l l
l l l l.
\\	\\	^	^	\\ 
|	|	|	|	/
/	v	/	v
.TE
.P
A "\fB+\fP" can also appear in the scroll bar in lieu of a "\fB|\fP",
giving the relative position of the cursor line in the bunch of input
words.
.SS "Terminal resizing"
The windows is redrawn if the terminal is resized. The redrawing is
actually done only 1s after the end of the resizing to avoid artefacts
on screen. The cursor will remain on the current selected word but may
be displayed on another place in the window.
.SS Unicode support
This utility is Unicode aware and should be able to display correctly
any Unicode character (even double-width ones) as long as the current
encoding is \fBUTF-8\fP (\fBUTF-8\fP in the output of the \fIlocale\fP
command).
.SS Configuration
If a file with adequate permissions and the same name as the executable
but prefixed with a dot is present in the current directory
or in the user's home directory, then it will be parsed as a
\fIini\fP file.
The values read from the file in the home directory will be overridden by
the ones read from the local directory (if it is present).

Missing and bad keywords are silently skipped.

The values read, if valid, override the default hard-coded ones.

If a value is invalid an error message is shown and the program terminates.

Here is an example giving the syntax and the names of the keywords
allowed:
.P

.fi
.IP * 2
The \fBmethod\fP keyword can take the two possible values displayed
above and determines if you want to use the native method (limited to 8
colors) of the \fBansi\fP method (ISO 8613-6) if your terminal supports
more than 8 colors. The default value corresponds to \fBansi\fP.

The attributes syntax is [fg][/bg][,toggles] where \fBfg\fP and
\fBbg\fP are numbers representing the foreground and background
color and \fBtoggles\fP is a strings which can contain the characters
\fIb\fP, \fId\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIs\fP, \fIu\fP and \fIi\fP  standing for
\fIb\fPold, \fId\fPim, \fIr\fPeverse, \fIs\fPtandout, \fIu\fPnderline
and \fIi\fPtalic.
.IP * 2
Spaces are allowed anywhere in the lines and between them, even around
the "\fB=\fP".
.IP * 2
Everything following a \fB;\fP is ignored.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-h\fP or \fB-?\fP"
Displays a log (\fB-h\fP) or short (\fB-?\fP) help message and exits.
.IP "\fB-n\fP \fIlines\fB"
Gives the maximum number of lines in the scrolling selection window. By
default five lines at most are displayed and the other ones, if
any, need you to scroll the window.
.IP "\fB-t\fP [\fIcolumns\fP]"
This option sets the tabulation mode and, if a number is specified,
limits the number of displayed columns to that number.

In this mode, embedded line separators are ignored. The options \fB-A\fP
and \fB-Z\fP can nevertheless be used to force words to appear in the first
(respectively last) position of the displayed line.
.P
.RS
Note that in this mode each column has the same width.
.RE
.IP \fB-k\fP
By default, the spaces surrounding the output string will be deleted.
This option forces them to be retained. Note that these spaces must have
been protected to be selected.
.IP "\fB-s\fP \fIpattern\fP"
Pre-Position the cursor to the first word matching the specified pattern.

\fIpattern\fP can be:
.RS
.IP * 2
A "\fB#\fP" immediately followed by a \fBnumber\fP giving the initial
position of the cursor (counting from 0). If this number if greater than
the number of words, the cursor will be set on the latest selectable
position.
.IP * 2
A single "\fB#\fP" or the string \fB#last\fP to set the initial
cursor position to the latest selectable word position.
.IP * 2
A string starting with a "\fB/\fP" indicating that we want the cursor
to be set to the first word matching the given regular expression.
.IP * 2
A \fBprefix\fP string indicating that we want the cursor to be set on the
first word matching the string given (\fBCa\fP will match \fBCancel\fP
by example).
.PP
Warning, when searching for a prefix or a regular expression, smenu
only looks for them after an eventual modification, so for example,
the command:
\f(CBsmenu -I/c/x/ -s/c <<< "a b c d"\fP won't find c and put the cursor
on \fBa\fP but \f(CBsmenu -I/c/x/v -s/c <<< "a b c d"\fP will find it and
put the cursor on the \fBx\fP substituting the \fBc\fP on screen only
.RE
.IP "\fB-m\fP \fImessage\fP"
Displays a message above the window. Beware, it will truncated if it
does not fit on a terminal line.
.IP "\fB-w\fP"
When \fB-t\fP is followed by a number of columns, the default is to
compact the columns so that they use the less terminal width as
possible. This option enlarges the columns in order to use the whole
terminal width.

When in column mode, \fB-w\fP can be used to force all the columns to
have the same size (the largest one). See option \fB-c\fP below.
.P
.RS
Note that the column's size is only calculated once when the words are
displayed for the first time. A terminal resize will not update this
value.  This choice enables a faster display.
.RE
.P
.IP \fB-d\fP
Tells the program to clean up the display before quitting by removing
the selection window after use as if it was never displayed.
.IP \fB-M\fP
Centers the display if possible.
.IP \fB-c\fP
Sets the column mode. In this mode the lines of words do not wrap when
the right border of the terminal is reached but only when a special
character is read. Some words will not be displayed without an
horizontal scrolling.

If such a scrolling is needed, some indications may appear on the left
and right edge of the window to help the user to reach the unseen words.

In this mode, the width of each column is minimal to keep the maximum
information visible on the terminal.
.IP \fB-l\fP
Sets the line mode. This mode is the same as column mode but without
any column alignment.
.IP \fB-r\fP
Enables \fBENTER\fP to validate the selection even in search mode.
.IP \fB-b\fP
Replace all non-printable characters by a blank.
.IP "\fB-i\fP \fIregex\fP"
Sets the \fBi\fPnclude filter to match the selectable words. All the
other words will become non-selectable (excluded)
.IP "\fB-e\fP \fIregex\fP"
Sets the \fBe\fPxclude filter to match the non-selectable words.

This filter has a higher priority than the include filter.
.P
The \fIregex\fP selections above are done before the possible word
alterations realized with \fB-I\fP or \fB-E\fP (see below).
.IP "\fB-C\fP [a|A|s|S|r|R|d|D][col1[-col2]],[col1[-col2]]..."
In column mode, restricts the previous selections or de-selections to
some columns. If no selection is given via \fB-i\fP and \fB-e\fP this
option gives the possibility to select entire columns by giving their
numbers (1 based).

\fBa\fP/\fBA\fP, \fBs\fP/\fBS\fP or nothing select the specified ranges
of columns. \fBr\fP/\fBR\fP or \fBd\fP/\fBD\fP select all but the
specified columns.

The words in the selected columns will be considered as included and the
others excluded.

Example of columns selection: \fI-a2,3,5-7\fP forces the cursor to only
navigate in columns \fB2\fP,\fB3\fP,\fB5\fP,\fB6\fP and \fB7\fP. If
\fBd\fP was used in place of \fBa\fP, all the columns would have been
selected \fBexcept\fP the columns \fB2\fP,\fB3\fP,\fB5\fP,\fB6\fP and
\fB7\fP.

Spaces are allowed in the selection string if they are protected.

The column mode is forced when this option is selected.
.IP "\fB-R\fP [a|A|s|S|r|R|d|D][col1[-col2]],[col1[-col2]]..."
Similar to \fB-C\fP but for the rows.

One difference though: this is the line mode which is forced by this
option NOT the column mode.
.IP "\fB-S\fP /\fIregex\fP/replacement string/[g][v][s]"
Post-processes the words by applying a regular expression based
substitution. The argument must be formatted as in the \fBsed\fP
editor.

This option can be used more than once. Each substitution will be
applied in sequence on each word. This sequence can be stopped if a
\fBstop\fP flag is encountered.

.RS
\fBflags:\fP
.IP * 2
The optional trailing \fBg\fP (for \fIg\fPlobal) means that all matched
occurrences shall be replaced and not only the first one.
.IP * 2
The optional trailing \fBv\fP (for \fIv\fPisual) means that the altered
words will only be used for display and search. The modifications will
\fInot\fP be reflected in the returned word.
.IP * 2
The optional trailing \fBs\fP (for \fIs\fPtop) means that no more
substitution will be allowed on this word even if another \fB-S\fP is
used.
.IP * 2
The optional trailing \fBi\fP (for \fIi\fPgnore case) means that the
string search operation should ignore the case for this pattern.

Small example:
\f(CBR=$(echo a b c | smenu -S /b/B/)\fP
will display \f(CR"a B c"\fP and \f(CBR\fP will contain \fIB\fP if \fI
B\fP is
selected meanwhile
\f(CBR=$(echo a b c | smenu -S /b/B/\fBv\fP)\fR
will display the same as above but \f(CBR\fP will contain the original
word \fIb\fP if \fIB\fP is selected. In both cases, only the word
\fIB\fP will be searchable and not \fIb\fP.
.RE
Notice that a substitution resulting in an empty string is equivalent
to removing the word.
.IP "\fB-I\fP /\fIregex\fP/replacement string/[g][v][s]"
Post-processes the \fBselectable\fP words by applying a regular
expression based substitution (see \fB-S\fP for details).
.IP "\fB-E\fP /\fIregex\fP/replacement string/[g][v][s]"
Post-processes the \fBexcluded\fP (or \fBnon-selectable\fP) words by
applying a regular expression based substitution (see \fB-S\fP for
details).
.P
The \fB/\fP separator that \fB-I\fP and \fB-E\fP are using above can be
substituted by any other character except \fISPACE\fP, \fI\\t\fP,
\fI\\f\fP, \fI\\n\fP, \fI\\r\fP and \fI\\v\fP.
.P
In the four previous options, \fIregex\fP is a \fBPOSIX\fP
\fBE\fPxtended \fBR\fPegular \fBE\fPxpression. For details, please refer
to the \fBregex\fP manual page.
.IP "\fB-A\fP \fIregex\fP"
In column mode, forces all words matching the given regular expression
to be the first one in the displayed line. If you want to only rely on
this method to build the lines, just specify an empty
\fBregex\fP to set the end-of-line separator with \fI-L ''\fP)
.IP "\fB-Z\fP \fIregex\fP"
Similar to \fB-A\fP but forces the word to be the latest of its line.
The same trick with \fB-L\fP can also be used.
.IP "\fB-1\fP ... \fB-5\fP \fIregex\fP [\fIATTR\fP]
Allows to give up to 5 classes of words specified by regular expressions a
special display color. They are called \fBspecial levels\fP. Only
selectable words will be considered.

By default, the 5 special levels have their foreground color set to
red, green, brown/yellow, purple and cyan. All these colors also can be
set or modified permanently in the configuration files. See the example
file above for an example.

The optional second argument (\fIATTR\fP) can be used to override the
default or configured attributes of each class. Its syntax is the same
as the one used in the configuration file:
.nf
[\fIfg\fP][/\fIbg\fP][,{\fIb\fP|\fId\fP|\fIr\fP|\fIs\fP|\fIu\fP|\fIi\fP}] \
| [{\fIb\fP|\fId\fP|\fIr\fP|\fIs\fP|\fIu\fP|\fIi\fP}]
.fi

Examples of possible attributes are:
.nf
  \f(CB2/0,bu \fPgreen on black bold underline
  \f(CB/2     \fPgreen background
  \f(CB5      \fPtext in purple
  \f(CBrb     \fPreverse bold
.fi
.IP \fB-g\fP
Replaces the blank after each words in column or tabular mode by a
vertical bar "\fB|\fP". Some users may find the output more readable
with it.
.IP \fB-q\fP
Prevents the scroll bar display. Useful when all the input words can be
displayed without the need of scrolling. By default the scroll bar is
always displayed when there is more than one line. An absence of cursor
in it gives a visual indication that all the input words are there.
.IP "\fB-W\fP \fIbytes\fP"
This option can be used to specify the characters (or multibyte
sequences) which will be used to delimit the input words. The default
delimiters are: \fISPACE\fP, \fI\\t\fP and \fI\\n\fP.
.IP "\fB-L\fP \fIbytes\fP"
This option can be used to specify the characters (or multibyte
sequences) which will be used to delimit the lines in the input stream.
The default delimiter is: \fI\\n\fP.

This option is only useful when the \fB-c\fP or \fB-l\fP option is also
set.

The characters (or multibyte sequences) passed to \fB-L\fP are
automatically added to the list of word delimiters as if \fB-W\fP was
also used.
.IP "\fB-T\fP [\fIseparator\fP]"
Enables the multi-selections or tagged mode. In this mode, each
selectable word can be selected without ending the program. The last
selection is then done as usual by hitting the \fBENTER\fP key which
also ends the program.

All the tagged words (and the world under the cursor) are then sent
to stdout separated by the optional argument given to the \fB-T\fP
option. Note than this \fIseparator\fP can have more than one character
and can even contain control character as in \f(CB$'\\n'\fP.

A space is used as the default separator if none is given.
.IP \fB-V\fP
Displays the current version and quits.
.SH NOTES
If tabulators (\fI\\t\fP) are embedded in the input, there is no way
to replace them with the original number of spaces. In this case use
an other filter (like \fIexpand\fR) to pre-process the data.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS 1
Simple Yes/No/Cancel request with "No" as default choice:
.P
.nf
\f(CRIn \fBbash\fP:
  \f(CBread R <<< $(echo "Yes No Cancel" \\
               | smenu  -d -m "Please choose:" -s /N)\fP

or
  \f(CBR=$(echo "Yes No Cancel" \\
      | smenu -d -m "Please choose:" -s /N)\fP

In \fBksh\fP:
  \f(CBprint "Yes No Cancel"                \\
  | smenu -d -m "Please choose:" -s /N \\
  | read R\fP
\fP
.fi
.SS 2
Get a 3 columns report about VM statistics for the current process in
\fBbash\fP/\fBksh\fP on Linux:
.P
.nf
\f(CBR=$(grep Vm /proc/$$/status | expand | smenu -b -W$'\\n' -t3 -g -d)\fB
.P
\fP
.fi
.SS 3
Create a one column selection window containing the list of the first
20 LVM physical volumes. At the end, the selection window will be erased.
This example is written in \fBksh\fP).
.P
.nf
\f(CB
pvs -a -o pv_name --noheadings                 \\
| smenu -m "PV list" -n20 -t1 -d -s //dev/root \\
| read R
\fP
.fi

The display will have a look similar to the following with the cursor
set on the word \fI/dev/root\fP:

.nf
\f(CRPV list
/dev/md126           \\
/dev/md127           |
/dev/root            | <- cursor here.
/dev/sda2            |
/dev/sdb2            |
/dev/sdc1            |
/dev/sdc2            |
/dev/system/homevol  /
\fP
.fi
.SS "4 (advanced)"
Imagine a file named \fBsample.mnu\fP with the following content:

.nf
\f(CR--8<---------------------------------
[1] "First Entry" [3] "Third entry"
[2] "Second entry" [4] "Fourth entry"
@@@ @@@ [5] "Fifth entry"
@@@
[Quit] "Exit menu"
--8<---------------------------------
\fP
.fi

Then this quite esoteric command will render it (centered on the screen) as:

.nf
\f(CR+--------------------------------+
|Test menu                       |
|1    First Entry  3 Third entry |
|2    Second entry 4 Fourth entry|

|                                |
|Quit Exit menu                  |
+--------------------------------+
\fP
.fi

with the cursor on \fIQuit\fP and only the numbers and "Quit" selectable.

\f(CBR=$(smenu -q -d -s/Q -M -n 30 -c               \\
          -e "@+" -E '/@+//'                   \\
          -i '\\[ *[^ ]+ *\\]' -I '/[][ ]//g'    \\
          -m "Test menu" < sample.mnu)\fP

The selected number or string will be available in \f(CBR\fP

Try to understand it as an exercise.
